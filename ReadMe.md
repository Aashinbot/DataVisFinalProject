#Data Visualisation final project

Chosen data set / area = Crime

First Question = Track 2: ’Analyse the development of crimes over time. Are there detectable trends in types of crime (e.g., theft, assault) over the past ten years?”

Potential Areas to go into 2 sides?

"How has law enforcement response time and crime-solving efficiency changed over the past ten years across different crime types? Are there disparities based on crime severity or location?

"How do crime trends, police response times, and crime-solving rates differ between affluent and less affluent areas, or between different countries? What factors contribute to these differences?"


Second Side?

"How has crime representation in video games and animated media evolved, and does it influence real-world crime trends?"

Does the release of major video games correlate with a temporary reduction in certain types of crime? A study on opportunity cost and digital escapism.
