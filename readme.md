#Data Visualisation final project

Chosen data set / area = Crime

First Question = Track 2: ’Analyse the development of crimes over time. Are there detectable trends in types of crime (e.g., theft, assault) over the past ten years?”



"How has law enforcement response time and crime-solving efficiency changed over the past ten years across different crime types? Are there disparities based on crime severity or location?

"How do crime trends, police response times, and crime-solving rates differ between affluent and less affluent areas, or between different countries? What factors contribute to these differences?"

"How do crime rates and law enforcement effectiveness vary between densely populated urban boroughs and more suburban or rural boroughs? What role does population density, police station closures, and community engagement play in these differences?"

For Part 3, it says that we should include a description of how the data is being processed, is that done in the d3 code, or will it be in the report, as in we should get screenshots of a particular visualisation on the app and say what data we encoded onto it including the data cleaning, or should we include it in the app itself with a short description underneath the visualisation?
<!-- Second Side?

"How has crime representation in video games and animated media evolved, and does it influence real-world crime trends?"

Does the release of major video games correlate with a temporary reduction in certain types of crime? A study on opportunity cost and digital escapism. -->
